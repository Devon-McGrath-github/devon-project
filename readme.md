#A Momentum Occasion
by Devon McGrath

#Impulse


The goal of my project is to help stop procrastination, to control those pesky,
distracting impulses (to watch youtube, to browse reddit, or any number of other distractions).
Hopefully you will find it useful as well.

##Idea

heavily based off momentum, a fantastic chrome extension and the inspiration for
much of this project. I am a junior web developer and wanted to recreate Momentum using React
to improve my skills, and to add the features that I felt were missing from Momentum. Each user
being able to their own background images for example (this feature has since been added but
still I press on).

#Setup
