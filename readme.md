#Personal Project

#Impulse


The goal of my project is to help stop procrastination, to control those pesky,
distracting impulses (to watch youtube, to browse reddit, or any number of other distractions).
Hopefully you will find it useful as well.

##Idea

heavily based off momentum, a fantastic chrome extension and the inspiration for
much of this project
