##Based off momentum
Momentum is what is known as a “start screen replacement” extension. That means you’re going to see it first thing whenever you open your browser. The stock Chrome start screen isn’t terrible but Momentum is way, way better. You can customize it to your tastes, create to-do lists, and they put a quote up every day to inspire you.


* The images are large, gorgeous, and Momentum is able to discern what time of day it is. That means when it’s night time, it’ll show you darker, night time images. It’s quite nice and worth a shot.
