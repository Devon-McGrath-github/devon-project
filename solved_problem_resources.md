Background Conundrum part 3:

Image compression.
 6.6 mb image as background, as one can imagine that is causing a slight, but noticeable loading time.
 Need to find a way to compress the images I recieve from the API, whilst either still having them hosted
 online (so I can link with a simple url) or to upload the images i recieve from the api myself after
 they have been compressed.
